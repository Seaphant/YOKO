# YOKO — STL and Print

STL part list, print settings [TBD], and orientation notes. 3D-printed parts for hand, joints, and mounts.

## Part List [TBD]

| STL file | Part | Qty | Notes |
|----------|------|-----|-------|
| [TBD] | Phalanx proximal | 5 | Per finger |
| [TBD] | Phalanx middle | 5 | Per finger |
| [TBD] | Phalanx distal | 5 | Per finger |
| [TBD] | Joint | [TBD] | Pin/bearing clearance |
| [TBD] | Motor mount | 5 | Per finger |
| [TBD] | Palm / base | 1 | Cable routing |
| [TBD] | Other | [TBD] | Strain relief, covers [TBD] |

Add rows as parts are finalized. STL files may live in this folder or external [TBD].

## Print Settings [TBD]

- **Printer:** [TBD]
- **Material:** [TBD] — e.g. PLA, PETG
- **Layer height:** [TBD]
- **Infill:** [TBD] — structural parts may need higher infill
- **Supports:** [TBD] — orientation-dependent
- **Temperature / speed:** [TBD]

Generic settings referenced in root README "How to Reproduce" until locked.

## Orientation and Supports

- **Orientation:** Minimize overhangs and support where possible; preserve strength along load direction (e.g. joint pins).
- **Support:** [TBD] — per-part notes when finalized.
- **Post-process:** Sanding, clearance ream [TBD] for joints; document in `../../artifacts/notes/mechanical_tolerances.md`.
