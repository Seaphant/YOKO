# YOKO — Images

Images for the YOKO robotic hand: **student side-project** style—homemade/iterative build and CAD viewport screenshots that match the rest of the repo (university project, internship portfolio, not corporate).

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **yoko-cad-screenshot-1.png** | **Screenshot only** (no laptop or monitor in frame): CAD viewport with the 3D hand—5 fingers, 3 phalanxes per finger, joints, palm base. Matches repo build (see `hardware/stl/`, `artifacts/diagrams/finger_linkage.md`). Grid, axis triad; student-CAD look. |
| **yoko-cad-screenshot-2.png** | Same: **screenshot only**, alternate view (e.g. side). Same geometry (5 fingers, prox/mid/dist phalanxes, joints, palm). Matches documented mechanical design. |

Optional (replace with your own when you have them):

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **yoko-appearance.png** | Homemade build: 3D-printed hand on a desk, visible layer lines, wires, workbench—DIY prototype for portfolio. |

## Style

- **CAD screenshots:** Pure application screenshots—viewport content only, **no photo of a laptop or monitor**. Styled to pass as authentic student captures: realistic CAD window (e.g. title bar, feature tree with project part names), matte viewport shading, subtle grain; not glossy or overly polished.
- **Geometry:** The hand in the screenshots is meant to match the documented build: 5 fingers, 3 phalanxes per finger (prox/mid/dist), joints, palm base—see `hardware/stl/README.md` and `artifacts/diagrams/finger_linkage.md`. Replace with actual CAD exports when you have them for exact alignment.
- **Appearance (if used):** Desk prototype, cables, iteration—fits “university student project” and internship narrative.

Replace these with your own CAD exports or build photos when you have them; keep the same low-key, student-project tone.
