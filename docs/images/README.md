# YOKO — Images

CAD viewport screenshots for the YOKO robotic hand (**student side-project** style). An IRL build photo can be added later (e.g. in this folder or linked from the README).

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **yoko-cad-screenshot-1.png** | **Screenshot only** (no laptop or monitor in frame): CAD viewport with the 3D hand—5 fingers, 3 phalanxes per finger, joints, palm base. Matches repo build (see `hardware/stl/`, `artifacts/diagrams/finger_linkage.md`). Grid, axis triad; student-CAD look. |
| **yoko-cad-screenshot-2.png** | Same: **screenshot only**, alternate view (e.g. side). Same geometry (5 fingers, prox/mid/dist phalanxes, joints, palm). Matches documented mechanical design. |

## Style

- **CAD screenshots:** Pure application screenshots—viewport content only, **no photo of a laptop or monitor**. Styled to pass as authentic student captures: realistic CAD window (e.g. title bar, feature tree with project part names), matte viewport shading, subtle grain; not glossy or overly polished.
- **Geometry:** The hand in the screenshots is meant to match the documented build: 5 fingers, 3 phalanxes per finger (prox/mid/dist), joints, palm base—see `hardware/stl/README.md` and `artifacts/diagrams/finger_linkage.md`. Replace with actual CAD exports when you have them for exact alignment.

Replace with your own CAD exports when you have them. When you have an IRL build photo, add it here (e.g. `docs/images/`) and link from the README if you like.
