## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **yoko-appearance.png** | Homemade, iterative look: 3D-printed hand on workbench, visible layer lines, wires/cables, desk setting—DIY prototype, not commercial. |
| **yoko-cad-screenshot-1.png** | CAD screenshot style: viewport with robotic hand model (wireframe or shaded), grid, axis triad—like Fusion 360 / Onshape / FreeCAD. |
| **yoko-cad-screenshot-2.png** | CAD screenshot style: alternate view—orthographic or isometric, tree/panel UI, dimension or feature list aesthetic. |

## Note

These are **conceptual** images for illustration. The appearance image suggests a homemade, 3D-printed iterative build; the CAD images suggest typical CAD-software viewport screenshots. Replace with real photos of your build or actual CAD exports when available.
